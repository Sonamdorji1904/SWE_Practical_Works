Applications developers design computer applications, such as games, for consumers. 
They may create custom software for a specific customer or commercial software to be 
sold to the general public. Some applications developers create databases or programs 
for use internally or online.

Systems developers create operating systems, either for the public or for an organization. 
These operating systems keep computers functioning and control most of the consumer electronics 
in use today, including those in cell phones and cars. Often, systems developers also build 
the interface that allows users to interact with the computer.

Of course, applications and systems developer jobs are not the only two positions available 
in the field of software engineering. Other common roles include mobile developers, applications 
architects, quality assurance analysts, and database administrators.
